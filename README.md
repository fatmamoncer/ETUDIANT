# Student Management System

## Overview

This project showcases the integration of Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, and Postman to build a simple Etudiant (Student) Management System. The application includes a Kafka producer responsible for producing messages related to students and a Kafka consumer that processes and consumes these messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** A powerful framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.
- **Apache Kafka:** A distributed event streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines.
- **Postman:** A popular API development and testing tool for exploring and interacting with APIs.

## Features

- **Message Processing:** Utilizes Kafka's publish-subscribe model for processing student-related messages asynchronously.
- **Spring Boot Integration:** Demonstrates the integration of Spring Boot to build a robust and scalable microservice for student management.
